### TODO
- Add more unit tests, for vehicle class properties and methods
- Also make sure we have all the search features as well as the ability to list all vehicles based on various properties
- Set defaults for vehicle properties
- Make sure IEnumerable is implemented correctly in Garage class
- Make sure we have the correct interfaces for the various Garage methods
- Implement a method for emptying the garage
- Sort out the menus so that there is a main menu and sub menus where necessary
- Implement feature to be able to save the garage onto a file for later loading (JSON)
- Feature: When we have parked a vehicle, the user should be notified that it was successful or not
- Code improvements: use func/action/delegate to make the code more readable and maintainable
- Improve on code comments as they are a bit messy atm
- Get a better workflow with git, this is not a good workflow
